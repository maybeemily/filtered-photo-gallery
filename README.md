Filtered Photo Gallery
===

Create a photo gallery app that has at least two filters for controlling
which images are displayed

## Image Data

You can use the supplied images data file or make up your own. Options for filtering this data:
1. keyword, title and/or description
    * exact match (`===`), or 
    * `.contains`, or 
    * `.startsWith`
1. horns
    * equal or greater than (`>=`)

## Process

1. Use Design-Driven Development to create the makeImages template (again like yesterday)
1. Use the Component Module pattern to have the `images-component.js` export a `loadImages` function used by `index.js`
1. Create the Filter Component. It will need to export `loadFilter` that accepts a callback. Remember the form work will have to happen inside the `loadFilter` function
1. Log the filter object in `index.js` so you know the Filter Component is wired up correctly.
1. TDD the `filterImages` function and move to own module
1. Incorporate the `filterImages` function into `index.js` and reload the images each time it changes.
1. Don't forget to remove the existing images when reloading!
